# flavorology
 
A fun little project built in ReactJS. It helps me and my partner remember our favorite recipes. You can add your own recipe and their ingredients. The added recipes can be viewed and the ingredients can be added to your grocery list.
It's a work in progress - a lot is still a bit buggy or not even working.
